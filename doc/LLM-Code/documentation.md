# Data Types

LLM-Code supports a wide range of data types that are commonly used in machine learning, including:

Tensors: Tensors are n-dimensional arrays of numbers that are used to represent data in machine learning models.

Vectors: Vectors are 1-dimensional arrays of numbers that are often used to represent features in machine learning models.

Scalars: Scalars are 0-dimensional arrays of numbers that are often used to represent labels in machine learning models.

Strings: Strings are sequences of characters that are often used to represent text data in machine learning models.

Lists: Lists are sequences of objects that are often used to represent collections of data in machine learning models.

Dictionaries: Dictionaries are mappings between keys and values that are often used to represent labeled data in machine learning models.

# Basic Grammar Examples

Here are some basic examples of how to use the data types in LLM-Code:

Python
import numpy as np

## Create a tensor
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])

## Create a vector
y = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

## Create a scalar
z = 5

## Create a string
message = "Hello, world!"

## Create a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

## Create a dictionary
data = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}

# Models Available

LLM-Code can be used with a variety of models, including:

- Neural networks: Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that is commonly used for tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

- Support vector machines: Support vector machines are a type of machine learning model that is commonly used for classification tasks.

- Random forests: Random forests are a type of machine learning model that is commonly used for classification and regression tasks.

- Decision trees: Decision trees are a type of machine learning model that is commonly used for classification tasks.

- Ensemble learning: Ensemble learning is a technique that combines multiple machine learning models to improve the overall performance of the system.

# Extension

This is a new programmatic language that is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is based on the concept of fixed-point combinators, which are functions that can be used to define other functions.

The language has the following syntax:

```
expression = identifier | number | string | boolean | list | function | fixed-point combinator
identifier = letter (letter | digit)*
number = digit+
string = '"' character* '"'
boolean = true | false
list = '[' expression (',' expression)* ']'
function = '(' identifier '->' expression ')'
fixed-point combinator = 'fixed' '(' identifier '=' expression ')'
```

The language has the following types:

* Numbers
* Strings
* Booleans
* Lists
* Functions
* Fixed-point combinators

Numbers, strings, and booleans are the basic types of the language. Lists are ordered collections of values. Functions are values that can be applied to other values. Fixed-point combinators are functions that can be used to define other functions.

The language has the following operators:

* + (addition)
* - (subtraction)
* * (multiplication)
* / (division)
* % (remainder)
* ^ (exponentiation)
* == (equality)
* != (inequality)
* > (greater than)
* < (less than)
* >= (greater than or equal to)
* <= (less than or equal to)
* && (logical and)
* || (logical or)
* ! (logical not)

The language has the following control structures:

* if-then-else
* while
* for

The if-then-else statement has the following syntax:

```
if expression then expression else expression
```

The while statement has the following syntax:

```
while expression do expression
```

The for statement has the following syntax:

```
for identifier in expression do expression
```

The language has the following built-in functions:

* print
* len
* head
* tail
* append
* reverse
* map
* filter
* fold

The print function prints a value to the console. The len function returns the length of a list. The head function returns the first element of a list. The tail function returns the list of all elements of a list except the first element. The append function appends two lists together. The reverse function reverses a list. The map function applies a function to each element of a list. The filter function returns the list of all elements of a list that satisfy a predicate. The fold function applies a function to each element of a list and accumulates the results.

The language has the following fixed-point combinators:

* Y
* Z

The Y combinator has the following syntax:

```
Y f = f (Y f)
```

The Z combinator has the following syntax:

```
Z f g x = f (g x)
```

The Y combinator can be used to define recursive functions. The Z combinator can be used to define functions that take other functions as arguments.

The language is a powerful tool that can be used to write a variety of programs. It is simple and easy to use, but it is also powerful enough to write complex programs.
