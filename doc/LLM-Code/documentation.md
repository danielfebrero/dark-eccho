# Data Types

LLM-Code supports a wide range of data types that are commonly used in machine learning, including:

Tensors: Tensors are n-dimensional arrays of numbers that are used to represent data in machine learning models.

Vectors: Vectors are 1-dimensional arrays of numbers that are often used to represent features in machine learning models.

Scalars: Scalars are 0-dimensional arrays of numbers that are often used to represent labels in machine learning models.

Strings: Strings are sequences of characters that are often used to represent text data in machine learning models.

Lists: Lists are sequences of objects that are often used to represent collections of data in machine learning models.

Dictionaries: Dictionaries are mappings between keys and values that are often used to represent labeled data in machine learning models.

# Basic Grammar Examples

Here are some basic examples of how to use the data types in LLM-Code:

Python
import numpy as np

## Create a tensor
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])

## Create a vector
y = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

## Create a scalar
z = 5

## Create a string
message = "Hello, world!"

## Create a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

## Create a dictionary
data = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}

# Models Available

LLM-Code can be used with a variety of models, including:

- Neural networks: Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that is commonly used for tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

- Support vector machines: Support vector machines are a type of machine learning model that is commonly used for classification tasks.

- Random forests: Random forests are a type of machine learning model that is commonly used for classification and regression tasks.

- Decision trees: Decision trees are a type of machine learning model that is commonly used for classification tasks.

- Ensemble learning: Ensemble learning is a technique that combines multiple machine learning models to improve the overall performance of the system.
